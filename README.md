## 1. 🎯 The Problem (Domain)
Managing modern cloud infrastructure during a traffic crisis is an impossible balancing act:
- **Want lower latency?** Add servers → *Cost and carbon emissions spike.*
- **Want lower cost?** Remove servers → *Latency degrades, users leave.*
- **Want lower carbon?** Migrate to green regions → *Latency and cost both suffer.*

No single metric can be optimized in isolation. SREs and Cloud Architects struggle with this daily. **CloudEdge** trains an LLM to navigate these competing constraints by negotiating between three specialist AI agents.

---

## 2. 🏗️ The Environment
Built natively on the **OpenEnv** specification, CloudEdge is a 30-step stateful simulation featuring randomized crisis spikes. 

**What the Agent Sees (Observation):**
The agent observes the current `latency` (ms), `cost` ($/hr), `carbon` (emissions), `load` (steady/critical), and the advice of three internal boardroom agents (Resource Agent, Cost Agent, Sustainability Agent). 

**What the Agent Does (Action):**
The agent chooses one of 4 actions: `scale_up`, `scale_down`, `optimize_energy`, or `migrate_region`.

**How the Agent Gets Rewarded:**
We designed a **Shaped Multi-Objective Reward** to prevent reward hacking:
- **Survival Penalty:** The agent accumulates negative rewards (-8, -6, -4) for every step metrics stay above target thresholds (Latency < 150ms, Cost < $400, Carbon < 220). This forces urgency.
- **Gap Closure Bonus:** The agent earns positive rewards (+0.1 per unit) for shrinking the gap between current failing metrics and the target thresholds.

## 3. 📊 Results: What Changed After Training?
We fine-tuned **Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct** using TRL's **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**. Instead of traditional PPO, GRPO evaluated 4 generations per prompt to find the optimal policy without needing a separate value model.

**After 512 training steps on a single Colab T4 GPU:**
- **Reward Skyrocketed:** Average shaped reward improved from **4.6** (untrained random baseline) to **6.8 (+48%)**.
- **Entropy Collapsed:** Action entropy dropped from 0.50 to 0.02, proving the model became highly confident in its policy.
- **Behavior Shift:** The untrained model spammed random actions. The trained model discovered that `optimize_energy` is the mathematical "golden path" to pull down cost and carbon without sacrificing latency, switching to aggressive scaling only when a randomized crisis hit.

## 4. 🌍 Why Does It Matter?
**Who cares?** Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), Cloud Platform Architects, and Climate/Sustainability Researchers.

**Why?** The tech industry is facing massive scrutiny over the carbon footprint and skyrocketing costs of AI data centers. Current autoscalers only look at CPU/RAM. By proving that an LLM can be trained via RL to successfully manage complex, multi-objective infrastructure crises, CloudEdge paves the way for **autonomous, climate-aware data centers** that heal themselves faster, cheaper, and greener than human operators can.

## 🔬 Deep Dive: Technical Implementation & Training Evidence


### Training Pipeline Setup (GRPO)
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Base Model | `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct` |
| Algorithm | GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) |
| Training Steps | 512 |
| Generations per Prompt | 4 |
| Learning Rate | 5e-6 |
| Temperature | 1.0 |
| Hardware | Google Colab T4 GPU |

### Environment Baseline vs. Trained Comparison
Below are the local simulation graphs demonstrating the agent's ability to maintain stable state across multi-step episodes compared to a random baseline.

### Anti-Reward-Hacking Measures

| Measure | How It Works |
|---------|-------------|
| **Randomised crisis timing** | Crisis intervals vary per episode — agents can't learn to pre-position for fixed schedules |
| **Repeated action penalty** | -4 reward for repeating the same action consecutively — prevents single-action spam |
| **Anti-oscillation detection** | Boardroom detects scale_up↔scale_down cycles and forces a different action |
| **Multi-objective reward** | No single metric can be gamed — all three must be below target simultaneously |

### Reward Scoring Example
Given a crisis state: `latency=280ms, cost=$620/hr, carbon=380` (all above target):

| Action | Latency Effect | Cost Effect | Carbon Effect | Worst Metric Bonus | **Total Reward** |
|--------|---------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| `optimize_energy` | +10 → -0.5 | -20 → +2.0 | -40 → +4.0 | ✅ +2.0 | **+7.5** |
| `scale_down` | +25 → -1.25 | -35 → +3.5 | -15 → +1.5 | ✅ +2.0 | **+5.75** |
| `migrate_region` | +15 → -0.75 | +10 → -0.5 | -50 → +5.0 | ❌ 0 | **+3.75** |
| `scale_up` | -40 → +4.0 | +30 → -1.5 | +20 → -1.0 | ❌ 0 | **+1.5** |
